\chapter{Internal Structure of the Deeplearning4j library}

\section{Architecture Overview}

On top on which tech dl4j is built? - schema - backend

\section{Run with different backends}
\subsection{Mathematical native libraries}
dense cpu
dense gpu
sparse cpu

\section{How data are stored ?}
\subsection{The basic array : NDArray}
In deeplearning4j all arrays are an NDArray object which represents a dense matrix or tensor. It contains a array of values and some information about the shape, the strides, ...

A lot of methods are available for getting a subarray, updating the values, reshaping, performing some operations,...
% show schema with interface-parent-impl-cuda-cpu?

\subsubsection{Data Buffer}
Databuffer is an object that stores an array in the native memory thanks to JavaCPP, how ?

\subsubsection{Shape information}
A NDArray is defined by multiples parameters
* shape : the actual shape of the matrix or tensors
* strides : defines how long is the step to the next dimension for each dimentsion
* offsets ?

All those informations are encoded in a unique databuffer

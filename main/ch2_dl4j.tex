\chapter{Deeplearning4j Library}

Deeplearning4j is a open-source Deep Learning library for the {JVM}. It runs on distributed CPU's and GPU's.

\section{Structure of the library}
The library is composed by several sub-libraries:

\begin{description}
	\item [Deeplearning4j] provides the tools to implement neural networks and build computation graphs
	\item [Nd4j] is the mathematical back-end of Deeplearning4j. It provides the data structures for the n-dimensional arrays and allow Java to access the native libraries via Libnd4j.
	\item [Libnd4j] is the computing library that provides native operations on CPU and GPU. It's written in C++ and Cuda.
	\item [Datavec] provides the operations for the data processing such that data ingestion, normalization and transformation into feature vectors.

\chapter{Sparse Linear Algebra}

A sparse matrix is matrix that contains only a very few non-zero element. Conversly, a matrix which contains mostly non-zero elements are dense.

The sparsity coefficient is defined by the number of non-zero element divided by the total number of element in the array.

density = 1 - sparsity

For example the matrix

has a sparsity of $\frac{4}{15}$ and a density of $\frac{11}{15}$.

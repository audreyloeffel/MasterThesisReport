\chapter{Conclusion}
 
 
 This work presents an implementation of a Compressed Row format (CSR) for sparse scalar, vector, and matrix. We also implemented the  Coordinate format (COO) for sparse scalar, vector, matrix, and tensor.
 
 To be able to perform accelerated sparse linear algebra operations we bound the Nd4j operation calls to the routines of Intel MKL Sparse BLAS for the two implemented formats.
 
 We compared the memory needed to store a sparse data set using the dense representation and the COO representation. We observed significant improvements: the sparse format allows us storing some big data set that would not fit in memory if they used the dense representations.

\chapter{Conclusion}
 
 We have a sparse format that supports scalar, vector and matrix in CSR
 We have a sparse format that supports scalar, vector, matrix and tensor in COO. 
 
 We have the binding for the first level of BLAS for COO and CSR.
 
We have the backbone to implement the next levels easily

We need to work on the native op

We need to implement cuda backend

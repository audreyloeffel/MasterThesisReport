Nowadays Machine learning is very popular and widely-used to resolve daily life problem

- deeplearning, neural net, self driving car etc

To work correctly and expect a accurate result, those machine learning problems require a huge amount of data. Such datasets are challenging regarding the execution time of the algorithms, the memory space required, the network usage when working imn a distributed environnement, etc

A big part of those problems used sparse datasets. For example a recommender system typically works with a dataset high-sparsity. This dataset contains the rating of movies or products given by the users. But usually the user only rated a very small subset of products.

That means, that if we know that our dataset will be sparse, we can used the sparse linear algebra to resolve the problem to optimized the memory used and the executing time.

Deeplearing4j didn't support any sparse format for vectors, matrices or tensors, neither the operations.

Deeplearning4j relies on Nd4j for storing off-heap and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays and for performing accelerated linear algebra operations. In this work we present the study and implementation of different sparse storage formats such as the Coordinates format (COO) and Compressed Row format (CSR) into Nd4j. We also explain the implementation of the native operations and the integration of the BLAS routines.

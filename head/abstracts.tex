Deeplearning4j relies on Nd4j for storing off-heap and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays and for performing accelerated linear algebra operations. In this work, we present the study and implementation of different sparse storage formats such as the Coordinates format (COO) and Compressed Row format (CSR) into Nd4j. Then we explain the integration of the sparse BLAS routines of the Intel MKL library and the implementation of the native operations in Libnd4j. Finally, we discuss the optimizations that could be possible about the sparse formats or the library architecture.

I would like to thank Professor Jäggi and François Garillot for supervising me during my work and giving the opportunity to accomplish my Master thesis at Skymind. I would also like to thank the Skymind team for helping me and particularly Raver for being always available to answer my questions and for helping me to see clearly into the depths of DL4j libraries. Finally, I would like to thank the SF-based Skymind team for having welcomed me for the 6 months.

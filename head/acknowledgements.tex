I would like to thank Professor martin Jäggi and François Garillot for supervising my work and giving me the opportunity to accomplish my Master thesis at Skymind. I would also like to thank the Skymind team for the help they provided and particularly Raver for being always available to answer my questions and for helping me get a clear and deep understanding of Nd4j. 
Finally, I would like to thank the SF-based Skymind team for having welcomed me for the 6 months.

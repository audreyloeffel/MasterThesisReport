I would like to thank Professor Jäggi and François Garillot for supervising me during my work and giving the opportunity to accomplish my Master thesis at Skymind. I would also like to thank the Skymind team for the help providing and particularly Raver for being always available to answer my questions and for helping me get a clear and deep understanding of Nd4j. 
Finally, I would like to thank the SF-based Skymind team for having welcomed me for the 6 months.
